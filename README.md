# GUI-Icon-Changer
This is a project I completed for my Object-Oriented Programming class. The goal was to design a Graphical User Interface application using the Model-View-Controller design pattern. The buttons at the top change the shape of the icon and the buttons at the bottom change the icon's color. The size of the icon can be changed using the slider. The Model manages the behavior of the application - setting the color, shape, and size of the icon. The View receives the information of what to display on the application from the Model. The Controller interprets the mouse inputs from the user (clicking the buttons and/or moving the slider) and informs the Model and View to change as appropriate.
Included in this repository are the fpur JAVA Files (Model, View, Controller, and Test) as well as a pdf of the UML class diagrams and a video demo of the working application.
